# Java Assignment: Concrete Class, Abstract Class, and Interface

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the differences between a **Concrete Class**, an **Abstract Class**, and an **Interface** in Java.

## Implementation
- **Interface (`Animal`)**: Defines a `makeSound()` method without implementation.
- **Abstract Class (`Mammal`)**: Implements the interface, provides a constructor, a concrete `sleep()` method, and an abstract `move()` method.
- **Concrete Class (`Dog`)**: Extends `Mammal`, implements all abstract methods, and provides a specific behavior for `makeSound()`.

## How to Run
### Compile using:
```sh
javac Main.java
```
### Run the program:
```sh
java Main
```

## Expected Output
```sh
Buddy barks: Woof! Woof!
Buddy is running...
Buddy is sleeping...
```
